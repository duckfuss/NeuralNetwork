# NeuralNetwork
Neural network built from scratch

# Intro

- Project start date: 25/05/24
- started during half term, idea was to create a neural network from scratch
- if possible reference my red notebook 2 for my notes - especially on the backprop derivatives
- did not use anyone else's code
- this is for future me before i forget!

# Instructions

- the dataset can be changed from MNIST to FASHION MNIST by changing:
  - neuralNetwork.py: generateNetwork() â†’ generateNetwork(dataType="FASHION")


# Resources used

- https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/backpropagation-calculus#computing-the-first-derivative (Main resource)
  - SUPER helpfull
- http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/ (but not the code sections)
- https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ccskgcoqgn

# Shortcomings
- runs on CPU - gets quite hot!!!

# TODO

* [ ] pickle the training
* [ ] add picture/doodle recognition dataset
* [ ] try a convolutional network next
* [ ] implement into connect 4?? - long term goal
